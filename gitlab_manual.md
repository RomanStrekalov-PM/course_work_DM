# Work with GitLab
## Creating a personal repository with the right .gitignore and a simple README.MD
On the left sidebar, at the top, select Create new () and New project/repository.
Select Create blank project.
Enter the project details:
In the Project name field, enter the name of your project. The name must start with a lowercase or uppercase letter (a-zA-Z), digit (0-9), emoji, or underscore (_). It can also contain dots (.), pluses (+), dashes (-), or spaces.
In the Project slug field, enter the path to your project. The GitLab instance uses the slug as the URL path to the project. To change the slug, first enter the project name, then change the slug.
In the Project deployment target (optional) field, select your project’s deployment target. This information helps GitLab better understand its users and their deployment requirements.
To modify the project’s viewing and access rights for users, change the Visibility Level.
To create README file so that the Git repository is initialized, has a default branch, and can be cloned, select Initialize repository with a README.
To analyze the source code in the project for known security vulnerabilities, select Enable Static Application Security Testing (SAST).
Select Create project.
